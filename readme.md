# Deep Learning-enabled Gait Assessment in Parkinson's Disease

This is the project homepage for our research on deep learning-based assessment of gait impairments in Parkinson's Disease using smartphone videos.

## Project Overview

We developed a novel framework that uses smartphone-recorded videos and deep learning to:
- Accurately assess PD severity (MDS-UPDRS Part III-Gait item)
- Discriminate medication effects on gait impairments
- Extract traditional and novel digital biomarkers
